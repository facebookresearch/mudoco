# Contributing to the MuDoCo dataset 
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process
Since this dataset is related to a publication and related experiments, we don't anticipate it changing much after the initial release.

If there is an egregious error or problem in some part of the MuDoCo data, please do submit a pull request containing a fix.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
